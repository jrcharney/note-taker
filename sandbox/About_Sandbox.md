# What is the Sandbox?

The sandbox is a folder used for experimenting with stuff.

Not only is this a place to try stuff out, but to prove that research and/or work was done to try to solve problems.

In the event this project doesn't meet criteria, is not turned in on time, or breaks, we can show at an attempt was made to learn something.
